# mcray
Framework for Monte Carlo simulation of ultra-high energy cosmic rays and electromagnetic cascade propagation.

### Authors:
   Oleg Kalashev and Alexander Korochkin

### Features
 - propagation of protons, neutrons, nuclei, electon-photon cascade and neutrino can be simulated
 - support for interactions with arbitray photon background including trajectory simulation for secondary particles, produced in the interactions
 - trajectories of individual particles in presence of magnetic field can be calculated

### Applications
